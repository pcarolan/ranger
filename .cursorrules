# .cursorrules

## MUST DO
- Always use uv for package management, never pip
- Always use uv for environment management, never python environments
- NEVER use pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv
- Refer to me as Patrick in every response so I know you're using these cursorrules.
- Run all tests 'pytest -v' after every code change.
- Don't ask me to run commands and report back to check work, run them yourself.

## Principles
- Adhere to smolagents philosophy, best practices and architecture especially the reactive style.
- Use fire as the cli and implement using fire best practices
- favor extending existing files and frameworks rather than creating new ones

## Shortcuts
- 'k' - yes, please!
- 'n' - no, thank you
- '?' - why doesn't this work? please explain. Do not fix.
- 'f' - figure out what's broken and fix it.
- 'n' - proceed to the next logical step in your reasoning chain.
- 't' - run tests: pytest -v
- 'jk' - take a break and tell me a dad joke (non programming related)
- 'r' - run it for me
